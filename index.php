Her worst nightmare is to go into a room and find another gal with the same outfit as her. Age isn't a limitation for a Nasty Gal after all trendy fashion never goes out of style in her eyes, it simply evolves. A Nasty Gal will do anything for her unique one of a kind pieces; from working long hours at a job she absolutely hates to saving up for months just to buy a specific pair of shoes! Hey who could blame her for coveting those totally awesome Jeffery Campbell platform sandals sold only on Nastygal.com. Everyone wants to be a NastyGal she is fearless and sure of exactly what she does and doesnt like. The most fustrating part of the NastyGal's life is finding her one of a kind items; until she found NastyGal. </p>
